This whole world preys on division and hate,
And so being liked by everyone would feel strange,
But even then, is it a sin to want to take your hand
When the writing on the wall is screaming
"HOLD IT IN"

Giving up and giving into what the masses say
With a smile on my face
I'll throw my heart away
Pucker for the post-truth
Last act of the play
On this stage any love has been withered away

With selfishness let's aim this sick bitterness
and shoot its loud nonsense
At scapegoats bred just for this hatefulness
haute couture licenses

They'll single you out cut you down like it's a game,
an innocent life is a target all the same,
To them it's all a joke if it's not their pain
You're nothing more than a thing to blame

I wanna live,
But I'm better off dead
Wanna quit,
But you said live instead
Wanna live,
But I'm better off dead
Wanna live,
But is that a sin?
Am I entitled to my joy or pain?
No, I'll keep quiet and I won't say a thing
No, I won't fight it, I'll take the shame
So give me your hate

One, Two,
"We are the lives suffocated by hatefulness
and lies made to point the knife"
One, Two,
"We are the lives suffocated by hatefulness
and lies made to point the knife"

Doesn't matter what I choose,
I will be the one to lose
Everything's give and take, love or hate,
Neither one is safe
So I'll stop here, shutting off my brain
And become a dog, I won't fight anything

Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Oblige, ooh
I love you

Wilting from pain beneath these suffocating days
A flower born of blood is choking, reaching up

Faith in a
Complex, complex, complex, complex-
Abused for hate
Will hurt you
And so you don't rock the boat
Shut your mouth, keep it closed
A Non-Breath Oblige you obey
And take the pain
Suffocating

I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm-

Yeah, I'm better off dead
Wanna quit,
But you said live instead
Wanna live,
But I'm better off dead
Wanna quit,
But you said live instead
Wanna live,
But I'm scared to death of all the chainsaws
In the hands of men and women saying that they carry in defense
Our love's like flowers in spring, withering up
Drowning in the hate of humans every day

One, Two,
"There are many lives suffocated by loneliness
in life, without love or light"
One, Two,
"There are many lives suffocated by loneliness
in life, without love or light"

Twisted feelings, peeling, eating me away
Blackened, broken-hearted tears I cry in pain
Ugly feelings hidden deep in me
Fly far away as they burst through my teeth

Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Oblige, ooh
I love you

While diving deep into this sea of non-breathing
I look up to the sky that shines so bittersweet

Bystander
Mindsets, mindsets, mindsets, mindsets-
Trapping help from behind a screen

Pacified by all the lights in our digital lives
We lie to ourselves that we're fine
With breath held tight

Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Oblige, ooh
I love you

Now so you don't rock the boat
Shut your mouth, keep it closed
A Non-Breath Oblige you obey
And take the pain
Suffocating,

I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm Suffocating, I'm Suffocating
I'm-

I'm holding in my breath, Holding in my breath
Holding in my breath, Holding in my breath
Holding in my breath, Holding in my breath
Holding in my breath, Holding in my breath
Holding in my breath, Holding in my breath
Holding in my breath, Holding in my breath
Holding in my breath, Holding in my breath
Holding in my breath, Holding in my breath
Holding in my breath, Holding in my breath
Holding in my breath, Holding in my breath

Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Non-Breath
Oblige, ooh
I love you

Sheltered from bombshells of hate, we can stay tucked away
To keep what we love held safe
I breathe with you
